# 🤖 ST-Copilot Image Dev (experimental)

This directory is an experimental fork of ST-Copilot v2.9.0 for STD testing. It is **not** an upstream release, **not** for main SillyTavern, and **not** auto-updated.

**Bridge dependency.** Image calls go through the private STD plugin at `/api/plugins/st-copilot-linkapi-image`. The browser never holds the paid key, never sets a production base URL, and never sends private image URLs to LinkAPI. Reference bytes are fetched locally and sent to the bridge as data URLs; the bridge sends multipart `image[]` parts on `POST /v1/images/edits`. Text-only requests use JSON `POST /v1/images/generations`. There is no retry and no fallback between those routes.

**Cost boundary.** One explicit natural request or one manual Generate click permits one paid image call. Apply and Reject do not call the provider. There is no regenerate control.

**Proposal meaning.** A pending card is a paid result that is not yet saved. Apply moves those same bytes into storage, attaches them to the Copilot answer, and records them in this roleplay chat's gallery. Reject deletes the temporary image and saves nothing.

**Destinations.** The chat gallery always receives applied images. Optional character-gallery copy appears only for one confident card owner and is off by default. Optional main-roleplay add is off by default and uses a system media message (`is_user: false`, `is_system: true`, one `extra.media` image, no ghosting flags).

**Reference route is unproven live.** Text-to-image is known to work for `gpt-image-2-c`. Real card/persona reference acceptance is not proven until one paid STD call. `(attached)` is added only when reference bytes are included in the request.

**License.** MIT, as in the upstream LICENSE. This fork does not claim authorship of ST-Copilot.

## 📸 Visual Tour & Features

Let's take a look under the hood. Here is what ST-Copilot brings to your SillyTavern experience:

### 1. The Command Center
![Copilot Chat Interface](Assets/Github/CopilotPaint.png)

This is your main hub. It functions completely independently of your main chat, packed with tools to control exactly how the AI sees your story.

**Top Bar Controls:**
*   **Search:** Instantly find past brainstorming ideas or lore discussions with `Ctrl+F`.
*   **Ghost Mode:** Toggle window transparency and click-through functionality on the fly so it never blocks your view.
*   **Settings:** Quick access to deep configuration, themes, and API routing.

**Chat & Context Tools:**
*   **Sessions Control:** Seamlessly switch between different brainstorming sessions, rename them, or create auto-deleting temporary ones to keep things organized.
*   **ST Messages Slider (CTX):** Dynamically adjust exactly how many recent messages from your main RP are sent to Copilot's memory.
*   **Lorebooks:** One-click access to the dedicated Lorebook Manager to tweak world info or review AI-proposed changes.
*   **Payload (Message Picker):** Don't want to use the slider? Hand-pick specific messages from your chat history to feed into the Copilot's context payload, ignoring everything else.

**Bottom Action Bar:**
*   **Raw Context:** A transparent inspector that shows you the exact raw text and JSON payload being sent to the API. Perfect for prompt engineers.
*   **Msg Regen:** Quickly force the AI to regenerate its last response if you didn't like the ideas it gave you.
*   **Quick Prompts:** Click the lightning bolt to reveal your custom shortcut buttons (like "Analyze", "Ideas", or "Summary") and speed up your workflow.

> **Wait, does it just write the story for me?**
> Not at all! ST-Copilot is strictly Out-Of-Character (OOC). Its system prompt explicitly forbids it from generating dialogue or actions for you or the main character. It's your sounding board, not your replacement.

### 2. Deep Configuration & Profiles
![Global Settings](Assets/Github/SettingsGlobal.png)

You have total control over how Copilot behaves. 
*   **Connection Routing:** Don't want to waste expensive API tokens on brainstorming? Route ST-Copilot to a completely different API profile (e.g., a cheaper local model) while your main RP uses your premium API.
*   **Context Inclusions:** Choose exactly what Copilot sees: System Prompts, Author's Notes, Character Cards, or User Personas.
*   **Profiles:** Bind specific Copilot configurations to specific Characters or Chats.

> **What if I only want specific settings for one specific chat?**
> We've got you covered. The **Session Overrides** tab allows you to temporarily alter settings (like context depth or max tokens) just for the active Copilot session without touching your global defaults.

### 3. Worldbuilding on Autopilot (Lorebook Manager)
![Lorebook Manager - Editor](Assets/Github/LB.png)

The crown jewel of ST-Copilot. A dedicated UI for managing your World Info.
*   View all active lorebooks (Global, Character, or Chat-specific).
*   Edit entries, triggers, and content on the fly.
*   **AI-Edits:** Ask Copilot to "Create a lorebook entry about the city we just entered." It will generate a Proposal Card in the chat. You can review the diff, edit the text inline, and apply it directly to your ST Lorebook with one click!

Stop guessing if the AI knows about a lorebook entry.
*   **Visual Indicators:** See exactly which entries were injected into Copilot's last API request (marked with an "in context" badge).
*   **Manual Overrides:** Force an entry to ALWAYS be included in Copilot's context, or NEVER be included, overriding SillyTavern's default keyword triggers.

> **Does Copilot automatically know my lore?**
> Yes! By default, "Auto-keywords" is ON. Copilot will scan your recent chat history and automatically inject relevant lorebook entries into its own memory, just like the main ST chat does.

### 4. Lightning-Fast Quick Prompts
![Quick Prompts](Assets/Github/Settings_QuickPrompts.png)

Tired of typing *"Summarize everything that has happened so far"*? 
Create your own **Quick Prompts**. Pick an icon, write the prompt (macros like `{{char}}` and `{{user}}` are supported!), and reorder them to your liking. They will appear as clickable chips right above your chat input.

### 5. Surgical Context Picking
![Pick Context Messages](Assets/Github/MsgsPayload.png)

Sometimes a slider isn't enough. If you want Copilot to focus on a specific past event, use the **Pick Context Messages** feature. 
Select exact messages from your RP history. ST-Copilot will completely ignore the rest of the chat and build its context *only* from the messages you checked.

### 6. Usage Statistics
![Statistics](Assets/Github/Settings_Stats.png)

For the data nerds out there. ST-Copilot tracks your usage across all sessions.
*   Track Messages, Regenerations, Active Sessions, and Lorebook Edits.
*   View beautifully rendered, interactive SVG graphs of your Token Input and Output.
*   Filter stats Globally, by Character, or by specific Chat over 30 days, 12 weeks, or even years.

### 7. Transparent Payload Inspector
![Raw Context Payload](Assets/Github/RawContextPayload.png)

Ever wonder exactly what is being sent to the API? Click the payload button to see the raw text (Formatted) or JSON structure being sent to the AI. Total transparency for prompt engineers.

### 8. Make It Yours (Theme Engine)
![Theme Settings](Assets/Github/Settings-InterfaceTheme.png)

A fully integrated, highly detailed theme editor.
*   Choose from gorgeous presets like *Dark Sky*, *Glass*, *Hacker*, or *Native ST*.
*   Use the integrated interactive color picker (with alpha/transparency support) to tweak every single background, border, and accent color.
*   Export your themes to JSON and share them, or import themes from the community.

*   **Fixes:** Implemented a potential fix for the "profile not found" error.

### V2.5.0
